# Among-Us-Game
Object Oriented Among Us Game - single player 


How to play:

When running this code - If you don’t have pyfiglet and termcolor installed then you can comment out lines that begin with cprint(). You can save this as a .py file on your computer and run the program from the command line by calling amongusgame.py. 

There are a few paths you can take but role assignment is random so you may have to play a few times to play as an Imposter and a Crewmate. 

If you’re a crewmate your job will be to complete tasks without getting killed by imposters. 

If you're an imposter your job will be to kill crewmates without getting caught. 

Good luck!
